The Sscofpmf extension [1] ('Ss' for Privileged arch and Supervisor-level
extensions, and 'cofpmf' for Count OverFlow and Privilege Mode Filtering)
allows the perf like tool to handle overflow interrupts and filtering support.

This series implements all the bits required to support "Sscof" extension and
few other fixes. This series can be found at github[4] as well. 
It has been tested with Linux kernel patches[3] for different hardware/firmware
events on Qemu.

This patch requires QEMU support series[2] to work. As the Qemu did not
support mhpmevent/mhpmcounter before this series, these changes are not backward
compatible to avoid code churn. Anybody who wants to use perf must include
Qemu, OpenSBI, Linux kernel patches.
